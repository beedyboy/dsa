# Solving Problems / Coming up with Algorithms

1. Verify the problem + the problem inputs E.g. is a an array of fixed length, does order matter etc.
2. Think about the problem + derive a verbal solution (= think loudly) i.e. Doesn't need to be the final or best possible solution! (Experience + practicing helps).
3. Write down a first version (e.g. in pseudo-code). Verify if it catches all possible use cases
4. Derive time complexity and see if you can improve your solution to do better

# Ways of Simplifying a Problem

1. Split into smaller sub-problems - Split arrays into chunks and possibly combine With Recursion
2. Use console.log() or breakpoints to verify what's in your (temporary) variables
3. Use helper variables (e.g. helper arrays to store intermediate results) => Don't worry about space complexity, don't aim for the shortest "no overhead" solution right from the start.

Finding good approaches to solve a problem takes practice - there is no simple "blueprint" that you can apply to every problem
